# 🔒 C-Lock: A Simple Password Generator in C

## ✨ Overview
C-Lock is a lightweight, command-line password generator written in C. It helps create secure passwords by randomly selecting characters from a mix of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. 🔑💻

## 🌟 Features
✅ Generates passwords of user-specified length 🔢  
✅ Includes uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters 🔠🔢  
✅ Uses a randomized approach with `rand()` and `srand(time(NULL))` for better entropy 🎲  
✅ Simple and easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI) 🖥️

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The program prompts the user to enter the desired password length. 📏
2. A password is randomly generated using a mix of characters. 🔄
3. The generated password is displayed on the screen. 🎉

## 🚀 Installation & Compilation
### 📌 Prerequisites
Make sure you have a C compiler installed (e.g., `gcc`).

### 🛠️ Steps
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/C-Lock.git
   cd C-Lock
   ```
2. Compile the program using GCC:
   ```sh
   gcc password_generator.c -o C-Lock
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```sh
   ./C-Lock
   ```

## 🎭 Example Usage
```sh
Enter the length of the password: 12
Generated Password: A7f$kL3!pQz
```

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
🔹 Allow users to specify character types (e.g., only letters, exclude special characters)  
🔹 Implement a GUI version 🖥️  
🔹 Improve randomness using a cryptographic library 🔐
